                Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a type
                of psychotherapy that helps people process traumatic experiences
                or intense emotions. It involves moving your eyes in a specific
                way while you think about a trauma. EMDR's goal is to change how
                the brain stores memories, which can reduce or eliminate
                problematic symptoms.
